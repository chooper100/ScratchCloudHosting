I am using Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise to build this project.

At the moment, it is standard console application.

Currently, I am using the Mircosoft.Net frameword 4.6 when compiling and will consider dropping down to a lower framework version once I have some stable code running.

Also, to parse JSON strings, I am using v7.0.1 of JSON.Net for .Net 4.5
You can download the binary and source code for JSON.Net here:

So yeah :)
